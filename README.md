## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Option 1: Using Nix + direnv (Recommended)**
- [Nix](https://nixos.org/) with flakes enabled
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/)

**Option 2: Manual Setup**
- [Bun](https://bun.com/) (latest)

### Installation

1. Set up the development environment

    **Option A: Using Nix + direnv (Recommended)**

    If you have direnv installed, allow the `.envrc` file to automatically load the Nix environment:
    ```sh
    direnv allow
    ```
    This will automatically install Bun, Process Compose, and other deps into your dev shell whenever you're in the project directory.
    It will unload when you exit and restore your path and env vars.

    **Option B: Using Nix without direnv**

    ```sh
    nix develop
    ```
    You'll need to run this command each time you want to load the dev shell.

    **Option C: Manual Installation** - Install the required tools manually as listed in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables.
    ```
    BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:5173
    BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
    ```

    Generate a Better Auth secret and add it to your `.dev.vars`:
    ```sh
    openssl rand -base64 32
    ```

### Running the Application

```sh
bun run dev
```

## Development

### Code Quality
